# Tennis scoring system
Develop a scoring system for tennis using javascript with TDD.

Javasript code is in public/javascripts/Tennis.js and test code is in
spec/javascripts/TennisSpec.js.

# Test is run by jasmine
In order to run test, please enter 

- rake jasmine

in your command line and enter localhost:8888 in your browser.

# Rules
The scoring system for tennis works like this.

A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.

The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as 0, 15, 30, 40, respectively

If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is "deuce".

If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "advantage" for the player in the lead.

# Constraints

We're just worried about one game, don't worry about sets, tie breakers, etc
Don't worry about validation, assume the client passes in correct data

# For example:

The interface will look something like this in Java:

  Game game = new Game("player 1", "player 2");
  game.pointWonBy("player 1");
  game.pointWonBy("player 2");
  // this will return "15-15"
  game.score();

  game.pointWonBy("player 1");
  game.pointWonBy("player 1");
  // this will return "40-15"
  game.score();

  game.pointWonBy("player 2");
  game.pointWonBy("player 2");
  // this will return "Deuce"
